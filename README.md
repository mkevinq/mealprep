## Setting up

After you clone / download this repository, open this folder with a command prompt / terminal and run `npm install`.<br />
This will install all the dependencies needed to run this app.

This app uses the spoonacular api, so please get an API key here: https://spoonacular.com/food-api

After you have cloned the repository, create a file called `.env` add this line to it using your API key:

```
REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_APIKEY=abcd1234
```

This .env file is ignored by git, so your API key won't be exposed to other collaborators.

**Please do not expose your API key publicly. Treat it like a password.**<br />

When you run `npm start`, you should see a page open up in your browser that shows your API key.

## Deployment

This app is not meant to be deployed, since your API key will be exposed.

A separate back-end server that handles sending requests to the API would be needed.

(Kind of like a middle man between this front-end app and the API.)

***

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
